# CRUD
This repository represents a final project of a class in my college

I was doing a project that would represent the final grade for a course called "OOP Fundamentals".

Basically, it is a interface that connects to a SQL table that I created, by doing the four simple functions, called CRUD (create, read, update, delete).

This code also respect the MVC pattern.
